It's saturday night in San Salvario. What in the daytime seems like a normal - although lively - district of Turin becomes one of the centers of the city nightlife as soon as everyone's had their dinner. It's not the only one, of course, but surely it's one of the most chaotic and intense - the streets are so full of people that even walking becomes complex, the cars trying to pass through have to move at a snail's pace, there's something happening anywhere you look and, most important of all, you are <i>guaranteed</i> to find someone you know. It can be some guy you did a group project with in school years and years ago, it can be an old friend you haven't seen since forever, or somebody you just met some days before, or a friend of a friend of a friend. It seems like the whole world's in that small slice of the city, and everybody knows it by heart; they know which bars make awful drinks, which ones cost too much, where's the main square, the church, and so on. 
So it's saturday night and I can't remember the last time I've been there. Over time I kinda grew bored of the dynamics of the place and its people, but enough time had passed and the idea of giving it a go didn't sound too bad. We find some high school friends by complete chance and after a little bit of chatter a weird story comes up.

Basically there's a Twitch streamer that has set up his studio in the beating heart of San Salvario, a small and completely visible room in which he records himself talking or playing for his audience. He got famous when, during a weekend night, a group of people started harassing him while he was streaming, only for them to take it too far and break the display window that separates his studio from the street. This whole story seemed very surreal to me at the moment - it got even weirder when we got in front of his studio.
The twitch logo was on the banner next to <i>Dankol83</i>, his username. That alone managed to make me feel strange: the internet and its entertainment culture had found a way to show up in the concrete world, in the architecture of the city. You could walk through the streets and, squished between a shop or a bar, find a streamer's studio and observe him while he speaks to hundreds of people, almost as if he was on display not only for the watchers at home, but also for everyone physically near him. 
Of course, this was all intentional. After a quick search I found out that he streams only in the evening and night and that most of his Twitch highlighted clips show interactions with the public: let the people - most oftenly drunk - spontaneously create the content for you.

Knowing you could become famous even for a couple of seconds is exciting, and your chances are even higher when you do stupid stuff. That's why there's a good bunch of people waiting in line to get in and have their moment of exhibitionism, between one drink and the other. An inoffensive looking bodyguard stands near the windowed door of the studio, saying that the streamer is just working and that nobody should even enter. Everybody knows that's not how things really are, though. 
Another thing that I found strange was that a place like that exists in an area that I had always thought of as extremely chaotic, full and everflowing. His room is decorated with just a computer, some screens and other technological devices; it felt paradoxical near the constant flux of people that surely do not have delicacy on top of their priorities. The fact that he laid out his setup in such a risky manner only accentuates that he wants dramatic situations to arise as much as possible. 
Me and my friends soon realize that, since we're standing in the view of the camera, we're in some part of the stream too, we're in the exhibition, and I kept thinking about it even after we all moved away. The fact that something like this can happen is interesting and it's one of the things that concretely reminds me that, well, it's 2022: entertainment got really, really strange; the real world is increasingly mixed up with the online world; and you can take part in public performances just by walking on the street.
