In these last few days I've watched a cool documentary called <a href="https://thoughtmaybe.com/q-into-the-storm/" class="redlink">Q: Into the Storm</a>. The Q phenomenon fascinated me, in a way, but I didn't get to research much about it yet - an online conspiracy theory developed by an anonymous figure, spreading cryptic prophecies and insider information, playing a big role in Trump's campaign and contributing to the storming of the Capitol Building after Biden's win in the 2020 elections? Sounds like a crazy footnote you could find on a history book from the future. I'm interested.

The documentary doesn't do <i>too</i> much to explain what the conspiracy is about - maybe because there's not that much to it - but basically the theory is that a cabal of cannibal satanics operate a global sex trafficking ring and Trump's secret mission was to expose them and fight them. The members of this cabal were said to be high calibre people like Hillary Clinton, Hollywood stars and government officials. One could say that it sounds a little bit less crazy after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein#Second_criminal_case" class="redlink">Epstein's arrest</a> in 2019, but Q supporters conveniently seemed to forget about Trump's numerous ties with the guy. Heh. The main theory was accompanied by other Q posts that tried to give insights about the current political situation in America, and posts with predictions about election results and whatnot.

There's a lot to think about when looking back at this. People will believe anything as long as their will to believe it is strong enough. Anonymity is very, very powerful. Maybe ideas born on the internet are more prone to getting attention, until they're ready to be released into the real world? Maybe people long for the mystique and this fills that void? Should these people really be banned from all social networks? Is this a new form of religion? These are all questions that the documentary hints at, but doesn't really explore fully. The thinking is left to the viewer - in fact, the reason why this documentary is so cool is another one.

While it tries to uncover the secrets behind the Q conspiracy, it becomes somewhat of a conspiracy itself. It tries to connect so many dots, so many people and events - is Q a secret psyop by the NSA? Is the government involved? What about these kinda random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada_3301" class="redlink">Cicada 3301</a> people? Or maybe the 8chan owners? 
The maker of the documentary started filming as the phenomenon was at its beginning and basically established a connection with all the top players involved. In fact, the documentary evolves together with the Q movement, ending arguably when the other ends too; not only, but the documentary itself plays a role in the succession of events.

It's kinda crazy that this exists. Very post modern in a way too. The documentary finds an answer - not the most important answer, maybe - but it finds out who was behind Q. Maybe they weren't the only person, and probably weren't there from the start, but this person was definitely involved. During the course of filming the filmmaker took this role of detective and became somewhat present in all the major events in Q's timeline, and the fact that he was there filming influenced Q's behaviour.

To me that's mind-boggling and it's what I liked the most about the series. I read an article that said this was a "gamified" documentary, as a critique, but for me that's its strength. It has an interactive quality, it's like an Agata Christie novel where you get to know all the characters, only that they are real and the stuff that happens has consequences in the outside world. To me, it's only right that such a crazy topic was approached in such a novel way.
