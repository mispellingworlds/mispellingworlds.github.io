I've played Proteus a couple of times and, during each of them, I had multiple moments of <i>joy</i>. Not for any particular reason: there's no conventional story to get emotionally attached to and no skill-based gameplay, I just felt overwhelmed with the beauty of it all. The way this game throws you in its world and makes you learn its language feels so good. Everything flows organically, everything feels so curious and magic, and <i>you</i> are the only one responsible for what you find or understand. I'll try and explain (without spoiling it) why this game resonated with me in a deeper way than other games I've played.

The gaming language established between Proteus and the player is simple, extremely simple. A few instructions on movement and that's it: the rest is up to you, no apparent goal is given. So the player feels free to discover everything on their own, approaching it with child-like curiosity and wonder; the details are so many and so curated that there's no risk of getting bored, even the simple things feel good. Eventually, after a while, some pieces will start fitting together, but in a completely natural way. In fact, this game takes a lot from nature, not only in the setting, but in how it goes down to the essence of what a game <i>is</i>. It backtracks from the current state of videogames, goes back to the roots, and says - what if we went <i>this</i> way?

To me that's very refreshing. I've always felt that the videogame as a medium could be really powerful and I'm happy that there's people pushing in other directions. I don't think that every game should be like this, of course; I just found it interesting that I had a more visceral reaction to Proteus than to the widely regarded "good games". If you look at the discussions on Steam you'll see a lot of people complaining: a popular statement is that "this is not a game", others ask "what's the point?", others are trolling about it being a secret AAA product ("how do you kill the boss at the edge of the jungle area?"). There are people loving it too, of course, but it's insightful that this game feels like an anomaly.

I also want to talk about the music. It's amazingly composed and it's a huge part of the gameplay, because the music gets shaped by what you do, where you go, what you interact with. The sonic landscape does not have a distinction between music and sound effects - the two interact and dance together in a very lively way. Proteus tells you a lot of things with its music, and it's so so good too. It would be a crime not to have sound on.
In fact I was so interested that I decided to snoop around the internet and I found a <a src="http://wombflashforest.blogspot.com/">blog</a> by the musician. It's a pretty damn cool rabbithole of ideas, he has very radical and fascinating views, from saying that one of his favourite games is a drawing app that lets you zoom infinitely, to concluding that the essence of games is music (music abstractly intended as an interaction with rhythm). Yeah, I was sure that the minds that developed Proteus were interesting.

Anyways, there's one more thing I'd like to say: in games like this poetry can continue to live on, in beautiful and exciting ways.
