I am very fascinated by this album from 1968. It's called <i>Intersystems</i> - <i>Free Psychedelic Poster Inside</i> and it tells a story about little plastic people living in a futuristic psychedelic world, all while raw electronic sounds beep and pulsate all over the place. The musical side may not be for everybody, but the lyrical content can stand on its own, as it's worth a read if you're into weirder stuff. It's funny that they were clearly having a laugh with the title, since it probably attracted many people that were looking for a stereotypical 60s type of psychedelia - only for them to get their hands on alien, raw synthesizers and a free poster that looked like this:

I do think it's truly <i>psychedelic</i>, though, just in a more transversal way. It takes you to a hazy untouched future and does a great job at worldbuilding. I decided to transcribe the lyrics online since I couldn't find any and they're not always clear; with a bit of patience (and Audacity's slowdown effect in the most uncomprehensible parts) I finished it. There may be a couple of errors, if you find them feel free to contact me and I'll update the text.

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">1. Mirror Maze</h3>

What I wanna lay on you first is some of the basic stuff. An interpretation of what is going down. This is a story about a little plastic boy and girl, his name is Gordy, her name is Renée. They are just like you and me: they get married, have a child and all other sorts of adventures out in the chemical world. You will learn to love them as your own children because they are very ordinary. Man, they are so ordinary we would like to be just like them when we grow up, fading off into the distance in all directions. Think that this plastic boy and girl all that they can see is themselves, think that is why the first location is mirrored. Twelve situations in a single location, there are two voices in every situation, everything fading away in all directions. Ends in a close-up personal sunset.
And so it develops that the boy meets the girl and natural we have dialogue like “Oh I don’t know what I’m gonna do with that boy”, “Oh I don’t know what I’m gonna do with my girl”.
Well about her, all her life her parents and her friends have told her how talented and beautiful she is, and that she has a future in show business, so the natural thing, she refuses to give up her career, she refuses to marry Gordy. And so what happens is that Gordy is putting her down; the refrain stands: “Gordy please, don’t put me down”. “Gordy please, don’t put me down”. So Gordy says to Renée “You wowed him Renée baby, and you wow me like you turn me on, your big man”. She says “You like me? Is that it?” 
So natural they are holding hands, running down the halls of life, smiling into the camera (you know what I mean, you know what it is that I am talking about). “Gordy please, don't put me down”. It is an ordinary love affair, they get married and move on. “I… I’d just like to say that I have used your product and I think it is wonderful”.
Renée still wants to get in with the smart women and the theatrical folks, and she likes the rest of the stained blemished vocable filled and fully raised youngsters.
Gordy wants to be tested by a  well recognized independent research and testing laboratory, but generally both of them are satisfied to be one of the thousands of smart men and women in all walks of life. As I said before, they get married and move on.
<br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">2. Red Strobe, Green Strobe</h3>

So it’s… Like I said they get married and move on. They move on in a very natural manner: they move right into a modern, psychedelic situation, they move into the modern home. Their minds expand immediately, it’s to be expected, everything is automatic.
Sitting in the living room, holding hands, he said “For Christ’s sake baby will you please turn off the strobe light?” She says “It is necessary, it does funny things to your brain”.
So they continue living in the little square house, with triangular rooms and… These are some of their adventures. They’re only in the house for a week and already they’ve got hassles. He says “Then you are not angry with me”. She says “No baby, I’m not angry, forget it”. “And listen to me”, she says, “I am not in love with you”, she says, “not right now but who knows, maybe one of these days I might fall in love with you.
“Baby” he says, “I am sure we’re on the right road to love”.
They stand looking out of the window of their new house and the sky is blazing with a million moons. He said “You are beautiful”, he said “You are beautiful”. He said “Things that we cannot control seize possession of us, and you have the same look. I hold your hand but I keep my eyes somewhere else.”
<br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">3. Blue Strobe</h3>

The usual tragedies occur. A straight parent or dog is involved. “I said oh please be safe my darling, please do not die, I said please do not die, you know death is a terrible thing, it can upset a whole day’s routine”. And this is just the beginning of our boy and girl’s amazing transformation. Small plaintive voices cry out from the depths of their troubled hearts.
They settle down and start to unravel the tangled threads of their lives. They remember the tender touch of their fingers when they first saw each other, and the magic of the first gentle kiss they… have a child, and suddenly a nameless fear grips them. They both knew that it would be hard at first but I don’t think they ever expected what happened next.
Everybody wants to be a star, rather than a burned out lightbulb. She loved him and he loved her and for a while, things seemed alright. Until “Oh no I don’t believe it my face my whole body seems frozen in terror hurry please - Hurry driver - you know that you have to hide your feelings, you know that you’re out of your tree and nothing seems to matter anymore, I feel so strange so confused it’s like a dream come true”.
“Hurry up doll I am buying the goodies, it’s a celebration”. And she said “But I am not selling the goodies, and what about the kids?”
“This is what I think of you and your idea of love” she slaps the guy, he drops his drink and all of the faded dream people look concerned. There is a dull ache in her arms. Gordy says “I love you baby, don’t you understand that?” And she says “no”, she says “I do not understand that”, at which point Gordy is led, heavily shackled and unresisting, seemingly almost insensate, into the gaudily festooned night shift throne room, and he thinks to himself that after everybody’s had their say (he’s gonna let everybody have their say) that he’s gonna tell them that the hour of reckoning has come at last, and with one powerful surge he will break free and finish something that was never started. She says “Gordy please, do not put me down”.

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">5. Changing Colours</h3>

And so what happens… That one day after a night of looking at the sky full of blazing moons, Gordy and Renée they decide to go out for a walk. They decide to go out for a walk in the changing world. And just like the books say, they notice everything in the world is always changing “Oh baby” and everything is different. “The walls of the world are not like the walls of our house”, they hold each other’s hand and sing. “Oh we are two small sheep who have lost our ways”. Then, as a token, she pins a flower on his vest. She says “This matches your baby blue eyes, Gordy” and he says “I’ve never noticed the color of your eyes Renée, they’re blue too, aren’t they?”. “No”, she says, “they aren’t blue” and so it turns out they have been pretty blind. “You’re beautiful” “Thanks, I do what I can boss”. “I do what I can boss”. Oh yeah… I have to tell you, at this point, that our young couple’s financial situation is not in a particularly healthy state. The big night of the year arrives. Dinner is very gay. The music is slow in the arms of this wonderful evening, the stars brighter than ever before. Music I have never heard is a toying rhapsody in my heart. Finally, it comes to an end, and Gordy says “Your eyes are brown”. Let me repeat that: Gordy says “Your eyes are brown darling. May I?”. She says, “Please do, don’t panic”. From now on anything you see was cut back. Cut back the young couple holding hands, hallucinating together.
Well here are Gordy and Renée, walking down the halls of life, it is the natural order of things: they’re starting to do better, and you know in which way, financially; their child is getting older. Renée lets her mind just back in time. The moon is full of romance. He had to give up on her career in show business and now Gordy is putting her down. “Gordy please don’t put me down”. I wanna tell you that this is a continuing drama of young love. I wanna tell you about Gordy, the handsome young investment counselor, I said investment counselor, a sly dog, you'd never guessed. They saw each other for business reasons.
<br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">6. Floating Room</h3>

Money, the life-giving rays of the sun. No words passed between them for none were needed to express what they felt for each other. “Darling, may I?” She said “Please do, don’t panic, from now on anything you say, boss”. And then the nameless fear gripped them, as in bygone years. The evening epigone was wild beatings of an innocent heart, the waltz of heaven opened. They can hardly stand, she says “Oh Gordy hold me, for I am young and in love”. And the floor doesn’t seem to be solid at all. You know what it is that I’m talking about, financially and stability, no need to talk about the lates, you’re always listening to the sound called "air" nibbling at your bare shoulders, oh what a wonderful wonderful moment. As I mentioned earlier, dinner is very gay. “Don’t panic, from now on, anything you say”.
<br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">7. Pastoral</h3>

So after dinner - which was very gay - Renée and Gordy went for a walk. They walk and walk and finally they walk right out of the city. This is the pastoral part of the story. They are walking in the plastic fields and they are young and happy, everywhere they look it is beautiful. They get down on their knees and they thank God for their blessings. Picture this scene out with the girl that you love, and there is something in the air, something that you can’t control, it keeps seizing possession of you. “I said you’re with me, beautiful, remember? I said you are with me, beautiful, do you remember? We are walking in the country, we are blessing God for our goodies”. This countryside is interchangeable and scientifically designed for real comfort. Familiar scenes drift past slowly, long dead images reawakened. Renée remembers sweet  impossible dreams, dreams of love, love like from the ashes from the past. And then the telephone rings. She picks up the telephone, it is Gordy. They sit opposite each other in the field and they have a conversation. When they are finished with their conversation, they hang up the telephone, they give a blessing and move on. She says “Go ahead and try”, and the telephone rings again. She says “Go ahead and try, maybe make me fall in love with you”. Taking the country air in the electric garden, Gordy starts to tell Renée something that has been on his mind for a long time, he says “You know, you have to hide your feelings”.  She says “Please don’t panic, I’m out of my tree and nothing seems to matter anymore.” He said “Please, do not die, I did what I had to do. I did the ordinary thing.” She said “What are you talking about?” He said “I hired a private investigator, to keep tabs on you.” She said “You can not be serious.” He says “Try to understand baby, I love you with my whole heart”. She says “I can not believe it”. She says “I can not believe it”. And Gordy hangs his head. He unplugs a flower and says “I suppose you never want to see me again, not that I’d leave you. Don’t hate me, I only did it because I love you, and we are married, and after all, and have kids, and please… don’t turn me off”. Renée, she starts laughing. He says ”What’s so funny?” He gets worried, he says “Stop that laughing, speak to me”. And then he pins the flower - which he has unplugged - on her blouse. “It does not match your eyes”. She says “Gordy please, don’t put me down”. He says “Baby please, don’t turn me off”.
<br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">8. Fog Room</h3>

So we have the young couple picking flowers in the electrical garden, looking upon the large projection screens, which are the walls of the world, contemplating the big projector in the sky, giving blessings and looking in each other’s eyes, feeling strange and dreamy, like confusion come true. “From now on, anything you say, I hold your hand but I keep my eyes in a separate bag”. And then the images start to come, they are fragmentary; that is, we do not get the whole picture, when I move, there is talking in the walls, and the words don’t make any sense. “Invest in show business”. This is a continuing drama of soaring rhapsody, we can’t control the sweet impossible dreams. I said “You are with me, beautiful, remember, I’m crazy about you, turn around young lady”. And without warning, you grab her. I said, you grab her, she says “Wait a minute, please”. Remember, you have got blue black hair, brushed straight back; you have a silk cravat at your neck, and you got no chin. She says, “Wait a minute”, he says “I will let my mind drift back in time and unplug all the flowers.” She says, “what a subtle way of telling me you’re a multi-millionaire”. Don’t forget to bow before the image.  He says “Stop grumbling, baby, you are part of it now, it’s just like old times. It will go on forever, or until somebody else stops, then we’ll stop laughing and we’ll go home. Forget your troubles and have fun. Maybe it will put you in a good mood and you will fall in love with me”. He said “I did the ordinary thing, I am a private investigator”. And then he asked “Why exactly did you give up showbusiness?” They are walking down the mirrored halls of life. “Why?” he says. “I am laying it on you straight, why did you give up show business?”. “Please, don’t unplug the flowers”. Strobe on. “Don’t hate me”. She says “I do not believe it”, then whispers, “Gordy please, don’t put me down”. Now, Gordy is that nice kid, Gordy. A little on the world side, but a nice kid, lots of talent, lots of talent; he was probably not born yesterday. And he has class, you know what I mean, it’s that certain something about you that could make you a big movie star, how about it. She said “Where are you going now?” “Back to my place, honey”. “What a subtle way of telling me you are a multi-millionaire”.
A young boy in love who keeps his eyes in another bag - please don’t turn the landscape off.
<br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">9. Kaleidoscope</h3>

I don’t think you ever expected what happens next, as Gordy and Renée take a cab back through the corridors of their life. They are fading off into the distance in all directions. A nameless fear, heavily shackled and unresisting. It is intermission, suddenly, and all the lights go on. They both stand paralyzed with shame, and the only thing that they can think of is to run in their panic. This adds further to their humiliation. Let us get down to the cracks of the story, do not let your hearts refuse to admit it, you still remember the thrill you felt from the last kiss, this is the end of romance and the beginning of love. They understand that Gordy and Renée were both too young when they got married, they had just gotten home from work. Somehow I found a taxi and mumbled the name of the hospital to the driver. Please don’t turn me off.
<br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">10. Confetti Room</h3>

This is the end of romance and the beginning of love for Gordy and Renée. Renée says “My God Gordy, the air is alive”. Gordy says “Stand back, I’ll handle this”, he says, bravely brandishing something. “Why, why it’s alive with confettis!”, says Renée, “just like our wedding”, she says, and they skip happily off. But that’s a different story. In this story, sadness, like an empty sky, fills their hearts. They are unable to stand the bright lights and laughter at the restaurant. And they wander back to the waiting room, where their hearts wrench them exposedly alive. “I am in a buying mood, one of the thousands of smart men and women in all walks of life”. "You can send the rest of the stuff with pleasure, the question of money is not involved". In the last shot, we have Renée, who has those kinds of eyes which are soft and yielding, and she is looking out of the sides of them, the background is red. Gordy is in the middle of a group of young girls, he is wearing a light purple check coat, and matching turtleneck. Gordy’s last act as an investment counselor, is to offer a Hollywood dream trip and an opportunity for motion picture MTV stardom to his girl, Renée. Her only answer is “Gordy, please, don’t put me down.”
