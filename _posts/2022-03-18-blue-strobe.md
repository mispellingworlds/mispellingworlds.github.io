The usual tragedies occur. A straight parent or dog is involved. “I said oh please be safe my darling, please do not die, I said please do not die, you know death is a terrible thing it can upset a whole day’s routine”. And this is just the beginning of our boy and girl’s amazing transformation. Small plaintive voices cry out from the depths of their troubled hearts. 
They settle down and start to unravel the tangled threads of their lives. They remember the tender touch of their fingers when they first saw each other, and the magic of the first gentle kiss they… have a child, and suddenly a nameless fear grips them. They both knew that it would be hard at first but I don’t think they ever expected what happened next.
Everybody wants to be a star, rather than a burned out lightbulb. She loved him and he loved her and for a while, things seemed alright. Until “Oh no I don’t believe it my face my whole body seems frozen in terror hurry please - Hurry driver - you know that you have to hide your feelings, you know that you’re out of your tree and nothing seems to matter anymore, I feel so strange so confused it’s like a dream come true”.
“Hurry up doll I am buying the goodies, it’s a celebration”. And she said “But I am not selling the goodies and what about the kids”
“This is what I think of you and your idea of love” she slaps the guy, he drops his drink in all of the faded dream people look concerned. There is a dull ache in her arms. Gordy says “I love you baby, don’t you understand that?” And she says “no”, she says “I do not understand that”, at which point Gordy is led, heavily shackled and unresisting, seemingly almost insensate, into the gaudily festooned night shift throne room, and he thinks to himself that after everybody’s had their say (he’s gonna let everybody have their say) that he’s gonna tell them that the hour of reckoning has come at last, and with one powerful surge he will break free and finish something that was never started. She says “Gordy please, do not put me down”.
