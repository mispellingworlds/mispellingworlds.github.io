        <div style="margin-left:15px; word-wrap: break-word; flex-shrink:3">
            A gorgeous blend of chamber music and field recordings. Violins, harp and piano effortlessly coexist with the everyday sounds of people chatting, cars honking, things getting moved around, getting scratched, folded and touched in an ASMR-like fashion. It's all so natural and connected that I can't help but feel stunned each time I listen to it.

<h4 style="color:#4b2a6b"><b>7038634357 - Electric</b></h4>
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:left; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="/assets/images/aoty22/electric.jpg" class="imgBorder" style="margin:auto; max-width:40%; float:left" alt="Electric">
        <div style="margin-left:15px; word-wrap: break-word; flex-shrink:3">
            <i>7038634357</i> is one of the most exciting and creative artists in electronic music right now. This release's sound palette is very well defined - the idea seems to be to mainly use the simplest waveform, the sine wave, as a basis for beautiful compositions and ingenious sound design. These sounds combined with deeply emotional melodies create an unique experience, beautiful and alien at the same time, poignant and subtle.

<h4 style="color:#4b2a6b"><b>Animal Collective - Time Skiffs</b></h4>
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:left; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="/assets/images/aoty22/anco.jpg" class="imgBorder" style="margin:auto; max-width:40%; float:left" alt="Time Skiffs">
        <div style="margin-left:15px; word-wrap: break-word; flex-shrink:3">
            On this album <i>Animal Collective</i> develop yet another interesting style, this time bringing xylophones, a hurdy-gurdy and a dub vibe to the table. The songwriting is rich and the production is very breathy and well done, with all the members bringing something to the table; there's just so many melodies and details to look out for. This is a full return to form and stays up there with the best of the band.

<h4 style="color:#4b2a6b"><b>Burial - Antidawn EP</b></h4>
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:left; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="/assets/images/aoty22/burial.jpg" class="imgBorder" style="margin:auto; max-width:40%; float:left" alt="Antidawn">
        <div style="margin-left:15px; word-wrap: break-word; flex-shrink:3">
            Curious and enigmatic, music that is similar to how it feels to play a videogame, if that makes any sense. It uses a lot of sound effects to make you feel like you are the protagonist, walking through rain, having various thoughts (or conversations?) while things happens around you. But it's also so much more than that. It feels really fresh and new, an exciting blend of music and storytelling.

<h4 style="color:#4b2a6b"><b>Specchiopaura - Napoli Undercore</b></h4>
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:left; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="/assets/images/aoty22/specchiopaura.jpg" class="imgBorder" style="margin:auto; max-width:40%; float:left" alt="Specchiopaura">
        <div style="margin-left:15px; word-wrap: break-word; flex-shrink:3">
            I was really excited for this record to come out and I was not disappointed. This duo from Napoli is effortlessly cool, mixing IDM-like electronics with guitars and hip hop sensibilities (a description that doesn't really do them justice but that's the best I could do). The lyrics are both in Italian and in the Napolitan dialect, creatively switching between the two. Super unique.

<h4 style="color:#4b2a6b"><b>Organ Tapes -唱着那无人问津的歌谣（Chang Zhe Na Wu Ren Wen Jin De Ge Yao)</b></h4>
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:left; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="/assets/images/aoty22/organtapes.jpg" class="imgBorder" style="margin:auto; max-width:40%; float:left" alt="organtapes">
        <div style="margin-left:15px; word-wrap: break-word; flex-shrink:3">
                Such a peculiar amalgamation of sounds and styles that one could call this outsider music. <i>Organ Tapes</i>'s signature vocals are here, mumbly and autotuned, along with his guitar, which he uses in a very inventive way; but that will never be enough to explain what is going on with the music itself. It's dense, emotional, real, a solemn statement about city life and faith, full to the brim of details and ideas.

<h4 style="color:#4b2a6b"><b>Malibu - Palaces of Pity</b></h4>
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:left; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="/assets/images/aoty22/malibu.png" class="imgBorder" style="margin:auto; max-width:40%; float:left" alt="malibu">
        <div style="margin-left:15px; word-wrap: break-word; flex-shrink:3">
            <i>Malibu</i>'s ethereal and cinematic ambient is very, very refined on <i>Palaces of Pity</i>. You can get all its details only by listening to it very loudly, but that's not a problem, since the music is so lush and well produced that your ears will not get any fatigue. The synths behave like sea waves, dragging beautiful new-age inspired vocals around.

<h4 style="color:#4b2a6b"><b>Talpah & Ciro Vitiello - Lost in the Colloid</b></h4>
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:left; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="/assets/images/aoty22/colloid.jpg" class="imgBorder" style="margin:auto; max-width:40%; float:left" alt="colloid">
        <div style="margin-left:15px; word-wrap: break-word; flex-shrink:3">
            Super HD electronic soundscapes depicting scenes that are sometimes beautiful, sometimes violent, sometimes uncanny, and sometimes calm. It's not easy to classify, it follows its own personal style and I love it for that - put on some good headphones and your mind <i>will</i> get fucked. Looking forward to hearing more from them in the future.

<h4 style="color:#4b2a6b"><b>Palmistry - Tinkerbell</b></h4>
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:left; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="/assets/images/aoty22/palmistry.jpg" class="imgBorder" style="margin:auto; max-width:40%; float:left" alt="palmistry">
        <div style="margin-left:15px; word-wrap: break-word; flex-shrink:3">
            A very surprising revelation. Ten quick and short tracks showcasing a huge variety of different styles, making it feel much longer and extended. Alternative R&B, acoustic guitars, field recordings, poetry, ambient, synthpop; all mixed together and embraced by the many collaborators of the project (notably <i>Yung Lean</i>, <i>Bladee</i>, <i>Isabella Lovestory</i>) which contribute in making it really fresh and diverse.

<h4 style="color:#4b2a6b"><b>Yabujin - ？？？？ 2021） </b></h4>
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:left; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="/assets/images/aoty22/yabujin.jpg" class="imgBorder" style="margin:auto; max-width:40%; float:left" alt="yabujin">
        <div style="margin-left:15px; word-wrap: break-word; flex-shrink:3">
            Seemingly dropping the cloud/experimental hip hop of his older works, <i>Yabujin</i> returns with a record that's a demented mix of weird internet aesthetics, jumpstyle, corrupted sounds, obscure samples and distorted mixing. It sounds like having a really bad trip and completely giving in to delirium while browsing YouTube, there's nothing else quite like it. Incredibly interesting artist.

<h4 style="color:#4b2a6b"><b>Duster - Together </b></h4>

        <div style="margin-left:15px; word-wrap: break-word; flex-shrink:3">
            This one gets the <b><i>COOLEST ALBUM COVER OF THE YEAR</i></b> award. I love it soooo muuccch.
