What I wanna lay on you first is some of the basic stuff. An interpretation of what is going down. This is a story about a little plastic boy and girl, his name is Gordy, her name is Renée. They are just like you and me: they get married, have a child and all other sorts of adventures out in the chemical world. You will learn to love them as your own children because they are very ordinary. Man, they are so ordinary we would like to be just like them when we grow up, fading off into the distance in all directions. Think that this plastic boy and girl all that they can see is themselves, think that is why the first location is mirrored. Twelve situations in a single location, there are two voices in every situation, everything fading away in all directions. Ends in a close-up personal sunset.
And so it develops that the boy meets the girl and natural we have dialogue like “Oh I don’t know what I’m gonna do with that boy”, “Oh I don’t know what I’m gonna do with my girl”.
Well about her, all her life her parents and her friends have told her how talented and beautiful she is, and that she has a future in show business, so the natural thing she refuses to give up her career, she refuses to marry Gordy. And so what happens is that Gordy is putting her down; a refrain stands: “Gordy please, don’t put me down”. “Gordy please, don’t put me down”. So Gordy says to Renée “You wowed him Renée baby, and you wow me like you turn me on, your big man”. She says “You like me? Is that it?” 
So natural they are holding hands, running down the halls of life, smiling into the camera (you know what I mean, you know what it is that I am talking about). “Gordy please, don't put me down”. It is an ordinary love affair, they get married and move on. “I… I’d just like to say that I have used your product and I think it is wonderful”.
Renée still wants to get in with the smart women and the theatrical folks, and she likes the rest of the stained blemished vocable filled and fully raised youngsters.
Gordy wants to be tested by a  well recognized independent research and testing laboratory, but generally both of them are satisfied to be one of the thousands of smart men and women in all walks of life. As I said before, they get married and move on.
