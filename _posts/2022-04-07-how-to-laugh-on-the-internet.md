One thing I've always found weird about internet language is <i>laughing</i>. How can you take such a spontaneous, immediate reaction as laughter and write it down while still making it feel honest? It's... very hard, for some reason. Not only that, but there's different kinds of laughing - each one of them with different nuances, used in different occasions, in different social groups. Yeeeah. I'll try and analyze some of them.<br><br>

This one is kind of basic. It's very safe, everybody knows it, you can use it while chatting with someone you don't know that well, or someone inexperienced with the internet. But the thing is that it's <i>too</i> neutral, too formal: people won't think you actually laughed. It also doesn't help that it's often used just to lighten up the conversation, even when there's nothing funny going on. <i>Yeah this lesson is so boring ahahahah.</i><br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA</h3>
The bigger, louder brother. This one's a bit better, you can actually imagine somebody having a thunderous laugh while typing. I like it, it feels more authentic and raw. The sad thing is that the all caps makes it feel mean-spirited at times, also some communities simply prefer other ways of laughing.<br><br>

Keyboard smashing. The idea here is that the content was so funny you just <i>couldn't</i> bother writing something meaningful. Sadly when you look at it it's obvious that it's a carefully planned keyboard smash, and depending on the situation, that fact alone can make it can obnoxious. Mix with the one above for a big loud laugh with a lil bit of randomness.<br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">lol</h3>
Kind of a weird one. Went from an internet acronym for "Laughing Out Loud" to being used even in normal, real life conversations, usually indicating something unusual or weird, never fully fleshed out "funny" though. <i>Oh that guy has a Big Chungus pin on his backpack lol</i>. Yup, perfect indicator of slight amusement.<br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">lmao & rofl</h3>
Let's be real, you never see anyone going <i>rofl</i> anymore. <i>lmao</i> has remained culturally relevant though, occasionally all caps and with extra o's for it to feel less sarcastic and more genuine. There's still something about it that doesn't sit quite right with me, maybe I've seen it used harshly too many times?<br><br>

This one's funny. I like this one. Just look at it, it sounds funny in your head when you read it, even the shape of the letters are fucking funny. It was born on World of Warcraft and it's used in many gaming circles and in places like discord or 4chan. Its flaw is that some deeply unpleasant communities adopted it as a distinctive symbol, so use it publicly at your own discretion.<br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">Laughing IRL</h3>
Among the most interesting. You are specifying that the content was so funny that you are laughing in real life, like, <i>actually</i> laughing; with the implication that other online laughter is fake. Can you blame them? I don't, and being somehow aware of the situation makes the expression feel more genuine.<br><br>


<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">I'm literally dying & My sides are in orbit & similar </h3>
Woah, these ones are very contrived aren't they? It's clear that they stem from disappointment with other laughing choices, and they try to make it a bit more poetic, with metaphors and whatnot. In my opinion they get awkward pretty fast.<br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">xD</h3>
What an incredible evolution, damn. When these types of emoticons became uncool everyone started using xD ironically, making it become the symbol of a very ridiculized internet culture. If you threw an xD at the end of the phrase everybody knew you were impersonating the stereotype of a dumb person. After a good number of years everybody seemed to let go, so these emoticons became used again in new, more sincere fashions - however the stigma associated with xD is still very high. And most of all, it doesn't really convey laughter, just more of a <i>lol</i> vibe.<br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£</h3>
Uhm... pretty sure everybody hates these with a passion. If they don't, they should.<br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">Facebook's Ahah react</h3>
When Facebook added reacts, one of them was deliberately chosen to indicate laughter. The idea works, somehow. You don't have to write anything, you have a button conveniently designed exactly for it. Well, it gets the point across and eliminates a bit of awkwardness from the equation, but it's also often used as a way to ridicule posts or opinions, with no actual laughter involved.<br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">Reaction pics, GIFS and Stickers</h3>
So it's pretty clear by now that written language is limited in this regard. That's why many prefer to just use stickers, reaction pictures, or anything that expresses the feeling in a direct way. Perfect for quick-messaging groups, informal occasions, image boards, but obviously limited because of their own nature. <br><br>

<h3 style="color:#4b2a6b">So what was the point of this?</h3>
I.. don't know. I just find it amusing that such a natural and simple expression as laughing is so difficult to express. There's so many different ways you could try and do it, but only a small part of them seems fit, the rest have taken different and weird meanings over time; I wanted to keep track of the current status. Language is getting more complex and faceted, visuals are getting more integrated with text and, in the end, it's kind of fucking hard to express what you <i>truly</i> mean.
