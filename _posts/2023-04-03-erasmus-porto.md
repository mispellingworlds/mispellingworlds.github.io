Our humble kitchen+living room is where most of our guests stayed. It got reimagined near the end of my stay, since one of the fridges was broken and just stood there, taking up space; we decided to defenestrate it (okay, not really - it just went through the door) and leave it in our terrace. The metal chicken on top of that fridge was empty and we decided to fill it up with wine corks. We only got just close, but our successors will definitely manage to finish the job.

My room was really messy most of the time. I used to think that making the bed was just a waste of time, since you'll just eventually get into it again, but yeah as it turns out it's a great way to create a more focused environment and be more prone to getting shit done. I also bought that whiteboard near the mirror to plan my days, and now I can't live without it.

The best part of the house. If it didn't rain <i>soooo</i> often I would have spent all of my time on this terrace.

This playing field was on the way to the closest metro station. I used to always have a look through the net because there was always something interesting happening; cats passing through, basketball games, an ad billboard continuously changing. That particular morning I found a beautiful sunrise.

The metro has six different lines that all share the same path when passing through the city centre, so that I usually had to wait at most two minutes whenever I wanted to go somewhere in that tract. Extremely comfy.

Living with architecture students had the nice effect of making me notice more of the stuff around me when walking down the street. What you see here is the <i>Social Housing in Bouça</i>, by beloved portuguese architect <i>Alvaro Siza</i>. These houses were located near my place and I always looked at them with a big sense of wonder and curiosity.

FEUP is where I studied at and it's where all the classes and labs happened. Best moment was making a project in Haskell - a game about two octopuses fighting eachother for territory - and, during the presentation to the professor, continuosly mistaking the word "tentacles" for "testicles".

University students can choose whether to become part of a students association and wear traditional suits and cloaks, participate in games, perform tasks, rank up and so on, game style. Those who do will wear those clothes even in the hot summer days, and even when not in university; some of them bring heavy wooden tools(?) with them on their shoulder, some will be found playing traditional music in bars over the city. It's pretty interesting when you go down the rabbithole, but it can appear weird at first.

I really wanted to go to the botanical garden for a lot of time, after finding it as an attraction on <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/porto-portugal">Atlas Obscura</a>. When I finally had time to go there, after the exams ended, it was winter and most of the plants were in very bad condition. Not the cacti though.

Porto is obsessed with its beer: Super Bock. You'll see it everywhere, bars have the Super Bock logo on everything, on their tables, chairs, umbrellas; every restaurant has it, there's ads for it everywhere, they even gave us Super Bocks on the welcoming day in university. In my favourite park, <i>Jardins do Palácio de Cristal</i>, there's an enormous building in the middle, which is called the Super Bock Arena. I always found it funny for some reason. As for the Super Bock beer itself? I love it, it's extremely drinkable and has a nice light taste.

The city's style is inconsistent in the best way possible. You never know what you're going to see when turning around the corner.

Me and my friends were on psychedelics, sitting in front of an amazing view of the river, but our eyes couldn't stop turning towards the beautiful blue in the windows of this house. A blue that didn't translate quite well in the picture.

This spot in <i>Jardins do Palácio de Cristal</i> was shown to me by a friend of mine, a Portuguese local. The one in the picture was probably the last true sunset I've watched while over there. Good times.
