The last few days have been crazy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludum_Dare" class="redlink">Ludum Dare</a> is a great excuse to put everything else on hold and, for a couple of days, concentrate on <i>one</i> particular goal: making a game & sharing it with others. Part of why it's so intense is that everything happens quickly, the decisions, the programming, the testing; the outside world kinda stops existing for a while. The thing is: when it all ends, it's so, so satisfying. You have a finished packaged experience in your hands, and you actively contributed to it creation.

This time around I am really happy with the output. I had some friends team up with me and they helped me along the way, so I only had to do the coding, the art and the story. Having someone take care of the audio and music saved me a lot of time, and their contribution was amazing too! <a href="https://mmisspelling.itch.io/penguin-rituals" class="redlink">Here's a link</a> if you want to check the game out and <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/penguin-rituals" class="redlink">here</a>'s the Ludum Dare page.

Some takeaways from my experience:

<ul>
    <li><h5 ><b style="color:#4b2a6b">Do something that excites you </b></h5></li>
        So, if I have to be completely honest, I didn't like the theme. "<i>Delay the Inevitable</i>" is bound to spawn a lot of endless runners and whatnot, which is fine, but I would have preferred something a bit weirder. It's ok though, I got comfy and started writing some ideas down. <br><br>

        <br>After a while I got an idea to do a game with penguins, I don't even remember why. The idea seemed so fun that I decided I'd definitely go along with it, because I knew it would keep me motivated, even if I didn't know how to fit it into the theme yet. Sometimes it's better to do something that keeps you inspired rather than something that's completely fitting.<br><br>
    <li><h5 ><b style="color:#4b2a6b">Use multiple tools</b></h5></li>
        This time around I decided to use Piskel for the art, because last time I really wasn't satisfied with Photoshop's animation interface. I quickly realized that Piskel didn't give me enough possibilities with brushes and other quirks that Photoshop instead has, so basically I started using both, Piskel for the simple pixel art and animations, and Photoshop for weirder lighting and filters and effects. Having multiple tools which are optimized for different purposes made the process much faster.<br>

    <li><h5 ><b style="color:#4b2a6b">Write clean code</b></h5></li>
        I used Godot as a game engine and I ended up really wishing I had read more documentation and had understood the workflow better. I made a mess with the code and the node system; I realized it very soon but I decided to build upon that anyways - bad, bad decision. I had to do a lot of manual work of copying and pasting, which took me a lot of time and could have been spent doing other stuff. I also had a hard time with collisions because I decided to deliberately do things my own way. I mean, it was alright in the end, but a thing to watch out for in the future.<br><br>
    <li><h5 ><b style="color:#4b2a6b">Working hard only the last day is (<i>kinda</i>) okay</b></h5></li>
        My progress was exponential: on the first day I had only wrote a very basic movement system and the NPC dialogue system; on the second day I had designed the levels and wrote some more mechanics; on the third day I drew almost all of the art, wrote all the story and dialogues, finished the mechanics, fixed all the bugs and all the rest. Seeing the timer tick away made me sprint, there's nothing quite like working under pressure for that extra dopamine. And you know what? I'm ok with that.<br><br>

    <li><h5 ><b style="color:#4b2a6b">Stuff gets made along the way</b></h5></li>
        I had so many ideas for this game, and so many of them were good! But I just let it take its own shape, because in the end you can't know what will work and what won't in advance. I wanted there to be multiple endings, a global timer, a way to choose between good and evil playthroughs, a more grim story. I wanted it to be about a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult" class="redlink">cargo cult</a>, which I still find an amazing idea, but it didn't fit the mood that was building up.<br><br>
    <li><h5 ><b style="color:#4b2a6b">Going away for a while is refreshing</b></h5></li>
        Pretty self explanatory. It's nice to just leave everything else on pause and to focus on developing and creating, more intensely than usual. 
</ul>
